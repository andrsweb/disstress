                                A distress deal is a property being sold urgently due to time or liquidity pressure — not
                                for marketing reasons. These are real situations where speed matters more than achieving
                                full market price. We verify every case before sharing it.

                                They are time-sensitive, discreet, and often sold before they ever reach public portals.
                                Public exposure can slow down urgent sales — and speed is the priority here.
