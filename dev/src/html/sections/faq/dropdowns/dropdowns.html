                                A distress deal is a property being sold urgently due to time or liquidity pressure —
                                not
                                for marketing reasons. These are real situations where speed matters more than achieving
                                full market price. We verify every case before sharing it.

                                New deals appear irregularly, and the best ones are often taken before they are ever
                                publicly shown. Limited supply is a feature of this market — not a flaw.

                                Prices reflect urgency, timing, and the seller’s situation. Every deal is reviewed to
                                ensure it represents genuine distress, not artificial price positioning.
